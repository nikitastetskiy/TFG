The main focus of this Final Degree Project is based on providing useful information, summarized and easily accessible to the end user, without it being overwhelming and difficult to read.

\vspace{0.3cm}

To this day, the most dominant social web applications on the market try to engage and keep the user as long as possible. They achieve this by providing a huge or almost infinite amount of information. This information is updated everytime, giving the possibility of staying involved in the social world almost forever.

\vspace{0.3cm}

Given the overwhelming abundance of information, I have decided to make a web application that provides you with information in a much simpler way about current trends. In this sense, users will not have to be so focused on keeping up to date, but at the end of the day they will have summarized the most valuable information and useful data based on the trend.

The project involves all the knowledge, both in computer engineering and outside of it, that I was able to acquire throughout my learning cycle in the computer field.

Going into more detail in the applied knowledge, the project is made up of a three-layer architecture: the user interface, a management layer and a data layer. The technologies used can be summarized in JavaScript, Python and NoSQL. JavaScript, specifically Vue.js for the Front-end section. For the Back-end, Python as the manager or processor and MongoDB as the database system.

\vspace{0.3cm}

By combining these technologies, the model that ends up being used is representational state transfer or REST API, in which different routes and web requests will be used, but which will continue to be a single application for the final user.
